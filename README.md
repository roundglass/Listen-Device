# Roundglass Sustain Listen : Realtime Acoustic

# Monitoring

- **_Listen_** ​ is a modular acoustic station (device) and software / program to analyze sounds
- **_Listen_** ​is an end-end solution to collect sounds on the ground to infer intelligence
- **_Listen_** differs from other acoustic stations available in the market in its ease-of-use,
    set-up and portability
- It relies on solar-power, long-lasting battery and a plug-n-play communication system
    that would transmit data real-time to a console or App or Web interface.
- The data will be available real-time on smartphone/tablet through an application and
    would enable users to make informed decisions. Potential users are conservation and
    law enforcement personnel (forest department primarily) and NGOs and local
    communities who are interested in conserving their natural heritage.
- The app has capabilities to view data as graphs and in other forms of visualization. (Ex:
    used to observe trend of data over a requested time period like the sound
    characteristics.

## How does ​ Listen ​ work?

## Roundglass Sustain - Listen: working illustration

Listen isolates ‘sounds-of-interest’ from the surrounding or ambient sound. Sounds-of-interest
can be defined according to our needs - gunshots, dynamite blasts, motor vehicles, timber
felling, etc. The unit(Listen Mote) is installed in field and designed to blend in with the
surroundings - hidden in the tree canopy, etc. This can stay deployed for at least 4 weeks
without a battery change. There exists an option to connect it to a solar charger for longer
deployments. 

High-sensitivity microphones coupled with a data transmission system form the
field unit (Listen Mote). Information is received at a base station over cellular network.
The audio recording based on the programmed recording frequency is uploaded to our cloud
database which is linked to our cloud based virtual analytics system, once the system
determines that a particular recording is of interest (anomaly in the environment) then an alert is
sent out to the respective authority.

We foresee a need for these devices in the coming years owing to increased awareness
regarding conservation issues and also due to severe shortage of enforcement and patrol
personnel guarding our protected areas.

## Hardware Features

**Application:** ​Android and iOS

## Applications

Protected areas are often vast, remote, with difficult terrain and severely understaffed to
effectively monitor and protect. With Roundglass Sustain Listen, we hope to plug in some of these gaps to
effectively monitor large areas and identify threats.

1. Detection of gunshots in protected areas - poaching and hunting increasingly rely on
    guns and is one of the leading causes of wildlife decline
2. Detection of dynamite fishing along rivers - illegal and highly destructive. The
    conservation and livelihood impacts of dynamite fishing is enormous
3. Detection of vehicular movement in protected areas - motor vehicles are used to illegally
    access areas for poaching, hunting and timber smuggling.
4. Another potential application (which we hope to address at a later date) is detection of
    wildfires


## Highlights​:

1. Detects, locates and alerts on threat sounds in less than 60 seconds.

2. Simple, affordable subscription service — no IT integration required

3. Get notified on your existing mobile phone via SMS / App notification.
